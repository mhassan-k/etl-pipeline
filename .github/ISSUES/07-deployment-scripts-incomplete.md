title: "Implement or remove incomplete CI/CD deployment scripts"
labels: ci-cd, deployment, infrastructure
---

## Description
The CI/CD pipeline has staging and production deployment jobs with placeholder code but no actual implementation. This creates confusion and a false sense of automated deployments.

## File Location
`.github/workflows/ci.yml:212-217, 232-237`

## Current Code
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to staging
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to staging environment..."
        # Add your staging deployment commands here  # ❌ Not implemented

deploy-production:
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production environment..."
        # Add your production deployment commands here  # ❌ Not implemented
```

## Impact
- Misleading CI/CD pipeline status
- Manual deployments still required
- No deployment automation
- Inconsistent deployments
- No automated rollback capability
- Deployment process not documented

## Proposed Solutions

Choose one approach based on your infrastructure:

### Option 1: Kubernetes Deployment
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  steps:
    - name: Set up kubectl
      uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3

    - name: Configure kubeconfig
      run: |
        mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
        echo "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG_STAGING }}" > $HOME/.kube/config

    - name: Deploy to staging
      run: |
        kubectl set image deployment/etl-pipeline \
          etl-pipeline=${{ env.DOCKER_REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }} \
          -n staging
        kubectl rollout status deployment/etl-pipeline -n staging
```

### Option 2: AWS ECS Deployment
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  steps:
    - name: Configure AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: us-east-1

    - name: Deploy to ECS
      run: |
        aws ecs update-service \
          --cluster staging-cluster \
          --service etl-pipeline \
          --force-new-deployment \
          --region us-east-1
```

### Option 3: Google Cloud Run
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  steps:
    - name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
      uses: google-github-actions/auth@v1
      with:
        credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS }}

    - name: Deploy to Cloud Run
      run: |
        gcloud run deploy etl-pipeline \
          --image ${{ env.DOCKER_REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }} \
          --platform managed \
          --region us-central1 \
          --project staging-project
```

### Option 4: Simple Docker Host Deployment
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  steps:
    - name: Deploy via SSH
      uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.STAGING_HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.STAGING_USER }}
        key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        script: |
          cd /opt/etl-pipeline
          docker-compose pull
          docker-compose up -d
          docker-compose ps
```

### Option 5: Remove Jobs (If Deployment is External)
If deployments are handled by external systems (ArgoCD, Flux, Spinnaker, etc.), remove these jobs entirely and add a comment:

```yaml
# Deployment is handled by ArgoCD in the k8s-deployments repository
# See: https://github.com/your-org/k8s-deployments
```

## Decision Needed

Before implementing, determine:
1. **Where** is the application deployed? (K8s, ECS, Cloud Run, VMs, etc.)
2. **Who** manages deployments? (GitHub Actions, external CD tool, manual)
3. **What** secrets/credentials are needed?
4. **How** should rollbacks be handled?

## Recommended Implementation Steps

1. **Document current deployment process** in README
2. **Choose deployment method** based on infrastructure
3. **Add required secrets** to GitHub repository settings:
   - Cloud credentials
   - SSH keys
   - Kubeconfig
   - etc.
4. **Implement deployment scripts** for chosen method
5. **Test in staging** environment first
6. **Add rollback procedures**
7. **Update documentation**

## Alternative: Deployment Documentation

If automation isn't desired now, replace the placeholder code with clear documentation:

```yaml
deploy-staging:
  steps:
    - name: Deployment instructions
      run: |
        echo "Manual deployment required for staging"
        echo "See docs/deployment.md for instructions"
        echo "Image to deploy: ${{ env.DOCKER_REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}"
```

Then create `docs/deployment.md` with manual deployment steps.

## Priority
**High** - Either implement or remove to avoid confusion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Decision made: implement automation or remove jobs
- [ ] If implementing: deployment scripts tested and working
- [ ] If implementing: required secrets added to GitHub
- [ ] If implementing: rollback procedure documented
- [ ] If removing: clear comment explains why
- [ ] Documentation updated with deployment process
- [ ] Tested end-to-end deployment flow
